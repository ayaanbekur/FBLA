                "content": "Okay! Here's a simple Python code example demonstrating how to calculate the factorial of a number:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.\n\n  Args:\n    n: A non-negative integer.\n\n  Returns:\n    The factorial of n (n!).  Returns 1 if n is 0.\n    Raises a ValueError if n is negative.\n  \"\"\"\n  if n < 0:\n    raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n  elif n == 0:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n      result *= i\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 5\nfact = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {fact}\")  # Output: The factorial of 5 is 120\n\nnumber = 0\nfact = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {fact}\") # Output: The factorial of 0 is 1\n\n# Example of error handling:\ntry:\n    number = -2\n    fact = factorial(number)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {number} is {fact}\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e) # Output: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`def factorial(n):`**:  Defines a function called `factorial` that takes one argument, `n` (the number for which to calculate the factorial).\n\n2.  **`if n < 0:`**: Checks if the input `n` is negative. If it is, it raises a `ValueError` because factorials are not defined for negative numbers.\n\n3.  **`elif n == 0:`**: Checks if `n` is 0. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1.\n\n4.  **`else:`**: If `n` is a non-negative integer (but not 0), the code proceeds to calculate the factorial.\n\n5.  **`result = 1`**: Initializes a variable `result` to 1. This will store the factorial value.\n\n6.  **`for i in range(1, n + 1):`**: This loop iterates from 1 up to and including `n`.\n\n7.  **`result *= i`**:  In each iteration, the current value of `result` is multiplied by `i`.  This is the core of the factorial calculation (e.g., 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5).\n\n8.  **`return result`**:  Finally, the function returns the calculated factorial value.\n\n9.  **Example Usage:**  The code after the function definition shows how to *call* the `factorial` function and print the result. It also demonstrates error handling using a `try...except` block.\n\nThis is a basic example, but it illustrates fundamental Python concepts like:\n\n*   Function definition\n*   Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)\n*   Loops (`for`)\n*   Error handling (using `try...except`)\n*   Variable assignment\n*   String formatting (using f-strings: `f\"The factorial of {number} is {fact}\"`)\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see a different example or have any questions about this one! For example, I can show you code for:\n\n*   Working with lists or dictionaries.\n*   Reading or writing to files.\n*   Making a simple web request.\n*   Doing basic math calculations.\n*   Something else entirely! Just ask."
